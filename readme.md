## Laravel app structure

Entries  
├── Actions/  
├── DTO/  
├── Exceptions/  
├── Models/  
├── Rules/  
├── Policies/    
└── ValueObjects/ 

Note: Classes for Controller, Middleware, Form Request will reside in their default folders.

## Angular app structure

core  
├── interceptors/  
├── models/  
├── services/  
├── utils/ 

## Motivation

PHP 7.4 is getting typed properties, which i'm really excited about. And having a type system provides a lot of value on project of any size, so i thought about experimenting by making this small project.

## Conclusion on Laravel Domain folders  
As of now this structure is working really well, let's see how it goes when adding more features. 

## Conclusion on frontend with Angular+Typescript

With typed language you have to write a bit more code, but trust me you'll love this over vanilla javascript. Also style guide provided by Angular team will help you improve your codebase.   https://angular.io/guide/styleguide
